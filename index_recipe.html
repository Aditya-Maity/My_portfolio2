            <h2>What is Chessecake ?</h2>
            <p>
                Cheesecake is a rich and creamy dessert made from cream cheese, sugar, and eggs, typically set on a
                crust made from crushed biscuits or graham crackers. It has a smooth and velvety texture, making it
                a popular choice for dessert lovers worldwide. Cheesecakes can be baked or unbaked, with variations
                in texture depending on the preparation method. The classic New York-style cheesecake is dense and
                creamy, while the Japanese version is light and fluffy.

                There are many flavors and toppings that enhance the taste of cheesecake, such as chocolate, fruit
                compote, caramel, or nuts. Some versions incorporate ingredients like lemon, coffee, or even matcha
                to create unique flavors. Cheesecake is enjoyed in different cultures, with variations like the
                Italian ricotta cheesecake and the German Käsekuchen. Whether served plain or with a rich topping,
                cheesecake remains a timeless and indulgent dessert.

            <h2>How to Make Cheese Cheesecake ?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Brick cream cheese: Four 8-ounce bricks of full-fat cream cheese are the base of this
                    cheesecake. That’s 2 pounds. Make sure you’re buying the bricks of cream cheese and not cream
                    cheese spread. There are no diets allowed in cheesecake, so don’t pick up the reduced-fat
                    variety!</li>

                <li>Sugar: 1 cup. Not that much considering how many mouths you can feed with this dessert.
                    Over-sweetened cheesecake is hardly cheesecake anymore. Using only 1 cup of sugar gives this
                    cheesecake the opportunity to balance tangy and sweet, just as classic cheesecake should taste.
                </li>

                <li>Sour cream: 1 cup. I recently tested a cheesecake recipe with 1 cup of heavy cream instead, but
                    ended up sticking with my original (which can be found here with blueberry swirl cheesecake!). I
                    was curious about the heavy cream addition and figured it would yield a softer cheesecake bite.
                    The cheesecake was soft, but lacked the stability and richness I wanted. It was almost too
                    creamy. Sour cream is most definitely the right choice.</li>

                <li>A little flavor: 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 2 of lemon juice. The lemon juice
                    brightens up the cheesecake’s overall flavor and vanilla is always a good idea.</li>
                <li>Eggs: 3 eggs are the final ingredient. You’ll beat the eggs in last, one at a time, until they
                    are *just* incorporated. Do not overmix the batter once the eggs are added. This will whip air
                    into the cheesecake batter, resulting in cheesecake cracking and deflating.</li>
